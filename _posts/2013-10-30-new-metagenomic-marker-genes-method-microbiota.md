Numerical ecology analysis of microbiota by metagenomic sequencing, currently depend on the availability of DNA sequences of microbial genomes in the public databases. Often this approach leads to biased interpretation because the majority of the microbial community has no reference genome. To overcome this methodological obstacle, the [MetaHIT](http://www.metahit.eu) consortium presented a new method that utilizes 
the presence of universally conserved in all identifiable bacteria 
in the microbial metagenome genes (known also as house-keeping genes[^2]) This new method[^1] has allowed to capture in silico twice as species and a practical example has allowed to describe that species richness was lower in ulcerative colitis patients compared to healthy individuals. This species richness decrease in particular patients was mainly due to the depletion of non-isolated bacteria belonging to Clostridiales. Based on this promising method a new software had been implemented[^3].
