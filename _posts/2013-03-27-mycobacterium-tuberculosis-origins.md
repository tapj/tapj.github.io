In 2006, I worked at Pasteur Institute (Sylvain Brisse groups) on characterization of special smooth strains isolated in Africa[^2] which seems to be related to _M.tuberculosis_ (known to have a rough phenotype). Using 16 housekeeping genes, we showed that those strains belong to the same species of _M. tuberculosis_ showing an higher diversity than previously observed. 

Following this work, in 2013, the Pasteur institute finally published[^1] a set of genome of those smooth strains concluding that _M. tuberculosis_ emerged from an ancestral pool of mycobacteria by gain of persistence and virulence mechanisms.
