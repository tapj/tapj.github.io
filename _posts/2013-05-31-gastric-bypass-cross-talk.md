Following their 
[story about gastric bypass](/index.php/actualites/11-actualites-scientifiques/43-microbiota-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass.html) 
and its impact gut microbiota and
metabolic parameters, AP-HP, ICAN and INRA scientists continued to bring new
discovers about the crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the host
adipocytes. Variations of gut microbiota after gastric bypass were associated
with changes in white adipose tissue gene expression. Those results may
stimulate deeper investigation about relation between gut microbiota and
adipocytes during weight loss.
