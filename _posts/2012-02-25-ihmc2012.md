The next _International Human Microbiome Congress_ (IHMC) organized by
[MetaHIT](http://www.metahit.eu/) be held in Paris, 19-21 March 2012, at the
Palais Brongniart. This conference is under the patronage of UNESCO and
supported by the European Commission. This is the largest conference on the
Human microbiome, the latest taking place in Shenzhen in 2010 and Vancouver in
2011.

Scientific exchanges will be around the analysis of the human microbiome, data
organization and interpretation. Then, researchers will present their recent
work about associations between the microbiome to human health and the
potential to modulate it. Finally, the conference will end around a debate
about the challenges of the future.

Personally, I invited you to pay attention on Iradj Sobhani's talk who will
present our latest study about colon cancer microbiome and we could have a
chat around the poster of Ling Chun Kong who will present our latest result
about the gastric bypass effect on gut microbiota.
