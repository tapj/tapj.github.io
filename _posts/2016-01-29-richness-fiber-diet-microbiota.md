A study[^1] published in [Enviromental Microbiology](http://bit.ly/AliminIntest) in September 2015 
showed how gut microbiota stability depend of its richness when individuals took high fiber diet. 
Using various methods to study the gut microbiome, we observed that higher microbiota richness 
was associated with higher microbiota stability upon increased dietary fibre intake. Metatranscriptomics analysis
showed that numerous glycan metabolism were also modulated comprising carbohydrate active enzymes.
Individual with higher richness and higher stabibility had higher diversity of short chain fatty acid 
comprisinng acetate, propionate and butyrate but also caproate and valerate compared to the lower richness microbiota.

In addition, this study showed that a simple food vegetable questionaire summarized into a __vegetable diversity index__ 
could be predictive of gut microbiota richness. Gut microbiota richness should definitly be taken into account 
before any nutritional intervention.
