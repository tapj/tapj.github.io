In a recent study[^1], we combined taxonomic, functional, and network analysis from shotgun metatranscriptomics 
analysis of fecal samples, which were collected during the ingestion of a habitual diet 
and two series of a 3-day high-residue challenge diet, before and following 28-days of fermented milk product (FMP) consumption.

FMP consumption was associated with the depletion of gas-producing bacteria and 
increased hydrogen to methane conversion. It also led to the upregulation of activities
such as replication and downregulation of functions related to motility and chemotaxis.

We showed new mecanistic insights about how active FMP may help to improve disgestive confort under high-residue challenge diet.
